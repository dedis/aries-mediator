# Reporting security problems

This library is offered as-is, and without a guarantee. It will need an
independent security review before it should be considered ready for use in
security-critical applications. If you integrate this module into
your application it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to arrange for that audit.

If you notice a possible security problem, please report it
to dedis-security@epfl.ch.
